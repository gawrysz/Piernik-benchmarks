# Piernik-benchmarks
This is a place to collect benchmarks made with Piernik code on various CPUs and systems.
By default it was run on Fedora 22 unless marked otherwise in some way.

_Note_: earlier runs were done with `-fstack-arrays` but it was switched to
`-fno-stack-arrays` to prevent crashes in some configurations.

Check out https://github.com/gawrysz/piernik/tree/benchmarking if you want to compare your system.
